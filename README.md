Hadoop Operations best practices
====

This repository will be used as a collection point for anything relating to operating Hadoop.

Starting 1st with the Hortonworks Workshop:

 - [Workshop slides](./workshop-slides.pdf)
 - [Workshop recording, on brighttalk](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9573/140277)
   - [<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rXK8zQf.png" width="320px" />](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9573/140277)

Content to follow shortly:

 - links to or files for for various non-Hadoop areas, such as (for a start):
   - disk burn-in
   - node prep
   - automation examples with shell and/or Ansible scripts

 - further details on Tenant Onboarding (i.e. bringing new/users/groups/projects into the environment)

Note that all content is built/tested around Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) but should translate to any distribution which is compliant with the open-source Apache components as HDP is built directly off of them.
