Hadoop Operations best practices
====

This repository will be used as a collection point for anything relating to operating Hadoop.

The initial content came from the Hortonworks Workshop of the save name:

 - [recording of the presentation on brighttalk](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9573/140277) [<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rXK8zQf.png" width="320px" />](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9573/140277)
 - [slides](./workshop-slides.pdf)

Content to follow shortly:

 - links to or files for for various non-Hadoop areas, such as (for a start):
   - disk burn-in
   - node prep
   - automation examples with shell and/or Ansible scripts

 - further details on Tenant Onboarding (i.e. bringing new/users/groups/projects into the environment)

Note that all content is built/tested around Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) but should translate to any distribution which is compliant with the open-source Apache components as HDP is built directly off of them.
